## Description <a id="description"></a> :page_facing_up:

This project utilizes mySQL, express, express-handlebars, bootstrap, and is hosted by Heroku. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate a model, view, controller architecture, different database operations a template engine and a deployment to Heroku using JawsDB. However...it isn't my best work as far as looks are concerned! :man_shrugging:
